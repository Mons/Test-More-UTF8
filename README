SYNOPSIS
        use Test::More;
        use Test::More::UTF8;

        # now we can easily use flagged strings without warnings like "Wide character in print ..."
        is("\x{410}","\x{420}"); # got a failure message without warnings

LIMITATIONS
        This module have reason only for perl 5.8 and higher

FEATURES
    This module also switch on by default utf8 pragma. To disable this, add
    "-utf8" option

        use Test::More::UTF8 qw(-utf8);

    By default binmode ':utf8' will be done on all output handles:
    failure_output, todo_output, output. It is possible to choose only some
    of them

        use Test::More::UTF8 qw(failure); # enable :utf8 only on failure_output
        use Test::More::UTF8 qw(todo); # enable :utf8 only on todo_output
        use Test::More::UTF8 qw(out); # enable :utf8 only on output
